The basics of MVC are as follows:

The logical topology is devided into 3 sections:
	1. The Model
		This should be where all of the data is
	2. The View
		This is where we display the data
	3. The Controller
		This is where we send user interations to modify the data
		
so a liniar run down would go..

Main Page
Load Model from data
Load Controller from Model
Load View from both Controller and Model

if there is input from user
	Collect input to send to the Controller
	Controller modifies the Data inside the Model
	
Display current data in Model, through the View
